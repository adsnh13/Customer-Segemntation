## Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end customer segmentation analysis. The goal is to explore customer behaviour, engineer meaningful features, and group customers into segments using unsupervised learning so that the business can target marketing, personalise offers, and identify high-value customers.

The analysis is implemented in the Jupyter notebook `Customer Segmentation.ipynb` and uses the dataset `dataset.csv` (paths in this environment: `/mnt/data/Customer Segmentation.ipynb` and `/mnt/data/dataset.csv`).

## Dataset

A CSV file (`dataset.csv`) which includes transactional and/or customer attributes used for segmentation. Typical columns in this type of dataset include `CustomerID`, `Recency`, `Frequency`, `Monetary`, demographics, and other behavioural/usage metrics. Please inspect the notebook for the exact schema and data-quality notes.

## Objectives

* Clean and prepare the raw data for analysis.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, outliers and correlations.
* Engineer features relevant to segmentation (e.g., RFM features, average order value, tenure).
* Use clustering algorithms (K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and optionally DBSCAN) to identify customer segments.
* Evaluate and profile the clusters to derive actionable business insights.

## Approach & Methods

1. **Data loading & cleaning** - handle missing values, correct data types, deduplicate records.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - distribution plots, pairplots, correlation matrices, and summary statistics.
3. **Feature engineering** - RFM calculation, normalization/scaling, transformation for skewed variables.
4. **Dimensionality reduction (optional)** - PCA or t-SNE for visualization and to speed up clustering.
5. **Clustering** - primarily K-Means with silhouette score and elbow method to select `k`. Alternative methods (Agglomerative, DBSCAN) may be compared.
6. **Cluster profiling** - interpret clusters using summary statistics and visualisations to craft short business-ready descriptions.

## Notebook & Files

* `/mnt/data/Customer Segmentation.ipynb` — primary analysis notebook.
* `/mnt/data/dataset.csv` — dataset used in the notebook.

Open the notebook to see code cells, charts and interpreted results step-by-step.

## Reproducibility - how to run

1. Clone or place the files in a working directory.
2. (Recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
.\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows PowerShell
```

3. Install dependencies (see `requirements` below):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook /mnt/data/Customer\ Segmentation.ipynb
```

5. Run the cells in order. If the dataset path differs, update the path at the top of the notebook.

## Dependencies

Minimal packages used in analysis (example):

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plotly (optional)
* scipy
* jupyter

Create a `requirements.txt` with pinned versions if you want exact reproducibility.

## Results & Insights (summary)

*(Open the notebook to view the visualisations and the full cluster profiling.)* Typical outputs include:

* Number of clusters chosen and justification (elbow method / silhouette score).
* Cluster-level summaries showing which segments represent high-value customers, new/at-risk customers, and occasional buyers.
* Recommended actions per segment (e.g., retention campaigns for at-risk customers, VIP offers for highest CLV segment).

## Project structure

```
/customer-segmentation/
├─ Customer Segmentation.ipynb
├─ dataset.csv

## Next steps / Extensions

* Build a lightweight API to serve cluster membership for online scoring.
* Use time-series features (customer lifetime trajectory) and sequence models.
* Use supervised models to predict a customer’s future cluster or churn probability.
* Automate re-training pipeline and integrate with business dashboards.
